# dataDyne MC Server Resources
This is the resource pack that the server pushes to the client on join.

Includes mostly custom assets for dDMC. This pack attempts to not replace anything in vanilla to still allow freedom in using resourcepacks. This pack serves as a bare minimum requirement for dDMC, but you *are* still intended to use the main pack in conjunction with this one, so any issues that arise from not doing so are not supported.

# Download
This does **not** need to be downloaded if you are playing on the server. If you are playing elsewhere and you want to use the custom assets, you can grab the latest release [here](https://github.com/Stormystic/server-resources/releases/latest) and enable it manually.
